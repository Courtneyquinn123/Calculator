# Simple Calculator

This project is a basic implementation of a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Usage

To use the calculator:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter numbers by clicking on the buttons.
3. Use the buttons for arithmetic operations: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division).
4. Press `=` to calculate the result.
5. Press `C` to clear the input.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Decimal support: Users can input decimal numbers.
- Error handling: Displays "Error" if an invalid expression is entered.

## Structure

The project consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) containing the structure of the calculator, along with inline CSS styling and JavaScript for functionality.

- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the calculator interface, including display area and buttons for numbers and operators.
- **style.css**: Defines the styling for the calculator interface, including layout and button appearance.
- **script.js**: Implements the logic for appending numbers, operators, and performing calculations.
